# YouTube Comment Spam Detector

This project focuses on detecting spam comments on YouTube videos using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify comments as either spam (1) or non-spam (0) based on their content. The solution leverages natural language processing (NLP) and optimized machine learning pipelines to achieve high accuracy.
